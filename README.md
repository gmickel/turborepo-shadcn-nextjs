## How to use 🛠️

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gmickel/turborepo-shadcn-nextjs.git
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
cd turborepo-shadcn-nextjs

## What's inside? 📦

This Turborepo includes the following:

### Apps and Packages 📚

- `@repo/docs`: a placeholder documentation site powered by [Nextra 3 alpha](https://the-guild.dev/blog/nextra-3) 📖
- `@repo/web`: the main [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) web application 🌐
- `@repo/ui`: core React components and design system shared by both `web` and `docs` applications (🎨 powered by **shadcn/ui**)
- `@repo/utils`: shared React utilities 🛠️
- `@repo/tsconfig`: shared `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo 🛡️

Each package and app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). 💪

### Utilities 🧰

This Turborepo has some additional tools already set up for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking ✅
- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for code linting, formatting, and fixing 🌿
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit tests 🧪
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for end-to-end tests 🧪
- [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for managing versioning, changelogs, and publishing 📝
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for component development and documentation 📚

### Storybook 📚

This Turborepo includes Storybook for component development and documentation. Storybook is set up for both the `@repo/web` and `@repo/ui` packages, allowing the development and showcasing of components from both your main application and your shared UI library.

To run Storybook:

```sh
bun storybook
```

This will start Storybook and open it in your default browser.

#### Story Location

Storybook is configured to find stories in the following locations:

- `apps/storybook/src/**/*.mdx`
- `apps/storybook/src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|mjs|ts|tsx)`
- `apps/web/src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|mjs|ts|tsx)`
- `packages/ui/src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|mjs|ts|tsx)`

This configuration allows you to write stories for components in both your web application and your shared UI library.

#### Storybook Addons

This setup includes several useful Storybook addons:

- `@storybook/addon-links`: For linking between stories
- `@storybook/addon-essentials`: A curated set of addons for a great developer experience
- `@storybook/addon-onboarding`: For onboarding new users
- `@storybook/addon-interactions`: For testing component interactions
- `@storybook/addon-themes`: For theme switching in Storybook
- `@storybook/addon-styling-webpack`: For handling CSS and PostCSS in Storybook
